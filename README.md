# Distributed PGO
Comparative Analysis of Implicit and Explicit Consensus Mechanism for Distributed Pose Graph Optimization.

At present, the related code is being organized, and we are extending it to asynchronous and parallel forms. It will be open-sourced once the modifications are completed. The program is modified based on the pioneering work in this field presented in [1].
